First what you need to do that's just copy this project to your own pc. Use git clone command in CMD or you can click on button (clone or download).

If you want to get started. Just run the CMD and put this command (npm install), and all the npm dependencies we need will be loaded. 
And then you can start work with Sass. And i forget add you need start a server just write CMD command (gulp) and server will be start.  Goodluck!
